## Expense Request Form
Reimbursements for expenses paid our of pocket and departmental visa reconciliations are processed through the UBC Arts Service Centre. Access the [Expense Request Form](https://finance.air.arts.ubc.ca/submit-a-form/expense-request-form/)
using your CWL. <br>

For travel related expenses (ex. conferences, field work) use the [Travel Expense Submission Form](https://finance.air.arts.ubc.ca/submit-a-form/travel-expense-submission-form/). 
Note that receipts are not required for meals per diem.

## Filling out the expense request form
Step 1. Specify the type of reimbursement you are requesting. If using the travel expense form, choose between expense claim, advance, or clearance.
  - Personal reimbursement: an expense that you paid using your own money (cash or card). Requires a receipt or proof of payment.
  - Direct payment to a vendor invoice: requires vendor name, invoice number, and a screenshot or pdf upload of the invoice itself.
  - Credit card reconciliation: an expense that was paid using a departmental credit card. Requires a receipt. <br> 
  

Step 2. If you selected personal reimbursement or credit card reconcilitation, specify if the expense includes claims to Professional Development funds. This is only for faculty.
