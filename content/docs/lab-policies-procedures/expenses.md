Reimbursements for expenses paid our of pocket and departmental visa reconciliations are processed through the UBC Arts Service Centre. Access the expense request form using your CWL. <br>
<ins>[Expense Request Form]([https://finance.air.arts.ubc.ca/submit-a-form/expense-request-form/])<ins> 

## Filling out the form
Step 1. Specify the type of reimbursement you are requesting. 
  - Personal reimbursement: an expense that you paid using your own money (cash or card). Requires a receipt or proof of payment.
  - Direct payment to a vendor invoice: requires vendor name, invoice number, and a screenshot or pdf upload of the invoice itself.
  - Credit card reconciliation: an expense that was paid using a departmental credit card. Requires a receipt.

Step 2. If you selected personal reimbursement or credit card reconcilitation, specify if the expense includes claims to Professional Development funds. This is only for faculty.
